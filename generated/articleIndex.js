Our most popular product [Coherent GT](https://coherent-labs.com/coherent-gt/) is a UI middleware for games and allows people to use HTML5 to create the UI for their games instead of whatever subpar UI system they currently have. It's now used by a huge number of games (e.g. PUBG, GuildWars 2, Law Breakers). The SDK is written entirely in C++.","meta":{},"lastEditDate":"2019-02-25T16:36:13.000Z","publishDate":"2018-02-04T16:28:39.000Z"},{"title":"On the purpose of Math in a CS curriculum","preview":"\r\nIt's been a while since I started [teaching programming at academia](/#/article/intro%20to%20programming%20materials) and the question of 'Why is there so much math in our curriculum?'* has been raised often by students. I thought I should put my 2 cents in writing.","meta":{},"lastEditDate":"2019-02-26T08:35:17.000Z","publishDate":"2017-03-04T16:13:50.000Z"},{"title":"Summer recap","preview":"The summer flew by already and I thought it's worth sharing some of the progress I made during it:","meta":{},"lastEditDate":"2019-02-25T16:10:10.000Z","publishDate":"2014-10-02T15:02:31.000Z"},{"title":"Extending C++ with properties","preview":"I love the programming concept of properties but I've never enjoyed using them in languages that have no native support, C++ being one of them. Properties being the concept of having things behaving like data fields in a class, which actually call functions that can control the flow of data.

This turned to be more of a [JavaScript library](https://github.com/NikolaDimitroff/Filterme.js) than the full-blown app I imagined, but nevertheless I had a lot of fun building it so I'll share the experience.","meta":{},"lastEditDate":"2019-02-25T22:38:01.000Z","publishDate":"2014-01-30T14:55:45.000Z"},{"title":"Validating complex user input","preview":"Sometimes you need to have an input field in your app for the user to enter a complex expression - like for a calculator or some bot commands. If you wanted to validated whether what the user entered was any valid, you would need to go through a lot of pain to write that check manually so let me offer you something faster and easier.","meta":{},"lastEditDate":"2019-02-26T08:32:49.000Z","publishDate":"2013-11-24T13:02:31.000Z"},{"title":"Intro to programming materials","preview":"This semester I'll be teaching Introduction to programming at [FMI of Sofia University](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/).

Some of you did it with recursion, others went a step ahead and used dynamic programming. Still, even with dynamic programming your algorithm was $O(n)$. We can go even further and write an $O(1)$ algorithm for finding the nth number of any sequence of the type:","meta":{},"lastEditDate":"2019-02-25T22:32:43.000Z","publishDate":"2013-08-16T12:25:51.000Z"}]
