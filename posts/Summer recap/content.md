The summer flew by already and I thought it's worth sharing some of the progress I made during it:

* Finally found time to create a more [personal CV][cv] - also includes an Easter egg
* An [AI Library in Python][adder-github] (also available on [PyPi][adder-pip]) that supports
searching in solution-space, Propositional, Predicate and Fuzzy logic
* A [LALR parser + translator][lalr-parser] in C++. Comes with a grammar and translation scheme for translating TypeScript to C#.
* A [interpreter for a functional language][flinterpreter]
* Further improvements on Thralldom, my WebGL game that follows the story of 'Under the Yoke'
* A stable version of [my team's last year entry to Imagine Cup][game-maker-news] which you can [test here][game-maker-demo] - Web-based game maker
* Restored and expanded my collection of [2D graphics demos][canvas-demos], some fancy stuff is in there.
* Fiddled with Unity3D and Skyrim SDK.
* I was a guest lecturer twice in [HackBulgaria][hack-bulgaria] - the best place to learn programming in Bulgaria.
* I am also going to teach *Data structures and Algorithms/ to sophomores in the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at the University of Sofia.

Finally, as of today, I am officially part of **[Coherent Labs][coherent]** - a Bulgarian company that changes the way game UI is built and used and I can't even express how awesome I feel about that.

That's pretty much it. Cheers.
