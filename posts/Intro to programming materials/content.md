This semester I'll be teaching Introduction to programming at [FMI of Sofia University](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/). To those of you lucky enough to be my fellow students (or to have found this page from another place), here's a list of materials to read about stuff.

Before listing all the resources I am about to recommend, do me a favour. If you are still using that e-mail address that you made when you were 12 – out with it. No one will take you seriously if you send people mail from marteto0o0o0o0o0@abv.bg - you are now a student and soon will be a employee, not a child. Create an address with your name/initials, preferably in [gmail.com][gmail]. Do that immediately and then return back to this page.

Now that you've set your email properly, take a look at the selection I've gathered for you.

### Books

Note about all books here - always try to find their latest editions as some contain major changes between editions.

#### C++

* [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++][programming-principles-practice] (Bjarne Stroustrup) – for absolute beginners, a quick jump start into programming and the language
* [Accelerated C++][accelerated-cpp] (Andrew Koenig, Barbara E. Moo) – for beginners that are really good learners or people that are accustomed to programming in another language. Heavy STL usage which is great since knowledge of STL is very important in any professional C++ environment.
* [Effective C++][effective-cpp] (Scott Meyers) – best second book to read about C++, contains all the tips and tricks you need to land a job in the industry. There's also [More Effective C++][more-effective-cpp] if you want more of it.

#### C&#35;

* [Fundamentals of Computer Programming][nakov-book] (Svetlin Nakov & Co.) – for absolute beginners, good intro book. Also available in Bulgaria
* [Accelerated C#][accelerated-csharp] (Trey Nash) – for programmers coming from other languages

#### JavaScript

* [The Good Parts][js-the-good-parts] (Doug Crockford) – the classic JS book
* [The MDN Library][mdn] (Mozilla Corp.) – although not a book, it's the best collection of articles I am aware of. C HTML, CSS and JavaScript

#### Algorithms

* [The Art of Computer Programming][art-of-programming] (Donald Knuth) – the bible for algorithms, one of American Scientist's '100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science'
* [Програмиране =++Алгоритми][programming++] (Preslav Nakov) – the definite Bulgarian book about algorithms

#### Work process, ethics, code architecture

* [The pragmatic programmer][pragmatic-programmer] (Andrew Hunt, David Tomas) - a book that aims to inspire you to care about your craft and take action to actively improve it on a daily basis. It's widely renown as a must-read.
* [Code complete][code-complete] (Steve McConnel) - a book that aims to teach you how to plan, design and execute rigorously to avoid the unpleasant surprises arising from inadequate planning. It's widely renown as a must-read.
* [Seven languages in seven weeks][seven-lang-week] (Bruce Tate) - the Pragmatic programmer suggests one should learn a new language every year. This book introduces you to seven languages in just 2 months.

### Videos

* [Mastering the craft][mastering-the-craft] (Stefan Kanev) - a great lecture in *Bulgarian*, covers similar concepts to the pragmatic programmer but in just an hour.

### Sites to register

* [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com) – this is probably the best source of knowledge for specific questions. It's a Q&A site that you'll surely get to use so the sooner the better.
* [github.com](https://github.com) – GitHub provides source control servers which people use to store and share code. Source control is the one and only way you should be storing and sharing code and the faster you dive into it, the better.
* [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) – online courses from top universities in the world, I'll sincerely recommend the courses by Stanford University and University of Melbourne.
* [edx.org](https://edx.org) – same as Coursera, but only hosts courses from MIT, Harvard, Berkeley and Texas.

### Blogs to follow

* [joelonsoftware.com](https://joelonsoftware.com) – Joel Spoelsky, co-creator of StackOverflow and Trello, I consider his blog the best in the world for how broad the topics are, his writing style filled with jokes and relatable stories, and for the all experience he's gained while leading FogBugz, StackOverflow, Trello
* [codinghorror.com](https://codinghorror.com) – Jeff Atwood is also a co-creator of StackOverflow and blogs about similar topics
* [skanev.com](https://skanev.com) – Stefan Kanev blogs in Bulgarian and talks about
* This site – may not be the best thing to follow, but years from now you'll be known as the first readers of that guy who made all those things in Computer Science a reality (and solved NP = P). Make sure to get an autograph while you can.
